MAJOR MODULES

- Data formats:
	FastD, FastC, FastS and EFastS to represent data used in RSQ.

- IO:
	Readers for each data format

- Predictor:
	Wrappers of a series of RNA secondary structure prediction tools.
	RNAfold, mfold, UNAFold, sfold, et. al.
	Note: make sure the command/program is callable in shell before call it in RSQ.
